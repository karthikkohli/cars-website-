<h2>1.MERCEDES-BENZ</h2> <img src="Mercedes-Benz GLA.webp" alt="" height="200px" width="400px"> </center> <p>The Mercedes-Benz GLA is a subcompact luxury crossover SUV manufactured and marketed by Mercedes-Benz over two generations. It is essentially the SUV equivalent of the A-Class, and the smallest SUV marketed by the brand.[2][3] The production version was revealed in August 2013 ahead of the 2013 Frankfurt Auto Show in September 2013.[4]

    The GLA is powered by a range of petrol and diesel 4-cylinder engines, and comes in either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, the latter marketed by Mercedes as 4Matic.
    
    The GLA nameplate aligns with Mercedes SUV nomenclature, where GL stands for Gel√§ndewagen (German for off-road vehicle) and the A designates its overall place in the Mercedes range, in this class, the smallest or A-Class</p>

    The X7 was first announced by BMW in March 2014.[4] It was officially unveiled on October 17, 2018, with pre-orders being taken online. The X7 has been available at dealers since March 2019.The G07 X7 is available in Design Pure Excellence, Sport and M Sport trims.[16]

    Standard equipment includes Vernasca leather, four-zone climate control, iDrive 7.0, Adaptive LED headlights, wireless charging,[17] and electrically adjustable and heated three row seating. The middle row features three seats with a two-seat configuration also available.[18] The X7 also receives driver assistance systems including autonomous cruise control and collision detection with braking intervention.[19] Other options include cooled and heated cup holders, a panoramic sunroof with LED light patterns, and laser headlights.[20] An off-road package adds selectable off-road driving modes and adjusts the ride height, acceleration and transmission response, and traction control system</p>


    <center><h2>3.VOLVO XC90 </h2> <img src="Volvo XC90.jpeg" alt="" height="200px" width="400px"></center> <p>The Volvo XC90 is a mid-size luxury SUV[1] manufactured and marketed by Volvo Cars since 2002 and now in its second generation.

        The first generation was introduced at the 2002 North American International Auto Show and used the Volvo P2 platform shared with the first generation Volvo S80 and other large Volvo cars. It was manufactured at Volvo's Torslandaverken. Volvo moved production equipment of the first generation to China and ended Swedish production at the end of 2014, renaming the car as the Volvo XC Classic (or Volvo XC90 Classic).
        
        At the end of 2014, the second generation XC90 was introduced. It is based on a new global platform, the Scalable Product Architecture (SPA). Both generations of the XC90 have won Motor Trend's SUV of the Year award in their debuts.
        
        In late 2022, the electric-only EX90 was introduced as the successor of the XC90.</p>
